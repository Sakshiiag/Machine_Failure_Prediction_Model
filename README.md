# Machine_Failure_Prediction_Model

The research aims on prediction of a machine failure using different machine learning algorithms. The classifier is selected on the basis of accuracy, f1-score and training time required. The minimum accuracy and F1-score score threshold is set to 90% so as to achieve better real world performance of the algorithm in terms of the ability to produce higher accuracy as well as the low time complexity.

## Aim:
Develop a robust machine learning algorithm for prediction of machine failure in a industry so that the person can keep a track of machine conditions and take the right precautions.

## Steps Taken:
##### Data Cleaning
##### Exploratory Data Analysis
##### Data Visualisation
##### Training & Testing Model
